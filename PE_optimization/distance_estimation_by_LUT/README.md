## distance_estimation_by_LUT_wrapper_systolic

Real Performance: 1306.35 ms (140MHz, suppose scanning 193 entries per Voronoi cell)

## distance_estimation_by_LUT_wrapper_systolic_double_buffer

Real Performance: 1357.5 ms (135MHz, suppose scanning 193 entries per Voronoi cell), this performance is exactly the same as without double buffer given the same frequency
